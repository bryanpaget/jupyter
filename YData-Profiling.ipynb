    "# YData Profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "`ydata-profiling`'s primary goal is to provide a **one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience** in a consistent and fast solution. Like `pandas df.describe()` function, that is so handy, ydata-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a DataFrame while allowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as html and json.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pip install ydata-profiling\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge ydata-profiling\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by loading your pandas `DataFrame` as you normally would, e.g. by using:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 5), columns=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the standard profiling report, merely run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "profile = ProfileReport(df, title=\"Profiling Report\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type inference**: automatic detection of columns' data types (*Categorical*, *Numerical*, *Date*, etc.)\n",
    "- **Warnings**: A summary of the problems/challenges in the data that you might need to work on (*missing data*, *inaccuracies*, *skewness*, etc.)\n",
    "- **Univariate analysis**: including descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc) and informative visualizations such as distribution histograms\n",
    "- **Multivariate analysis**: including correlations, a detailed analysis of missing data, duplicate rows, and visual support for variables pairwise interaction\n",
    "- **Time-Series**: including different statistical information relative to time dependent data such as auto-correlation and seasonality, along ACF and PACF plots.\n",
    "- **Text analysis**: most common categories (uppercase, lowercase, separator), scripts (Latin, Cyrillic) and blocks (ASCII, Cyrilic)\n",
    "- **File and Image analysis**: file sizes, creation dates, dimensions, indication of truncated images and existence of EXIF metadata\n",
    "- **Compare datasets**: one-line solution to enable a fast and complete report on the comparison of datasets\n",
    "- **Flexible output formats**: all analysis can be exported to an HTML report that can be easily shared with different parties, as JSON for an easy integration in automated systems and as a widget in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report contains three additional sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overview**: mostly global details about the dataset (number of records, number of variables, overall missigness and duplicates, memory footprint)\n",
    "- **Alerts**: a comprehensive and automatic list of potential data quality issues (high correlation, skewness, uniformity, zeros, missing values, constant values, between others)\n",
    "- **Reproduction**: technical details about the analysis (time, version and configuration)\n",
